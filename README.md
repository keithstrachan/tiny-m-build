# tiny-m-build
This is my particular spin on the Tiny-M build, a Voron V0 using Mitsumi 2020 Extrusions.  The Voron machines are home build high performance printers. With the V0 being the smallest of the series. The numbering scheme, V0, V1, V2 represent different machines, so don't get confused that's it's a revision.

Since I've not started the build yet, the first things I'll link are the Voron V0 build and the Tiny-M repo.
I'd like to use a small direct hot end instead of the standard Voron V0 Boden so that it will easily print flexable material.
In addition, I really like the two position hinged TopHat by hartk1213

First off, there is a very active Discord channel for VoronDesign. The users are really helpful and friendly which for a home build
3d printer is a huge win.
